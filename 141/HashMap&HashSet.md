# HashSet
HashSet is used to store objects, it don't allow duplicate elements, by using "public boolean add(Object obj)" to add elements to the set, if success return true else return false
# HashMap
HashMap is used to store key-value pairs, it don't allow duplicate keys, bu using "public Object put(Object Key, Object value)" to add elements to the map.

HashMap will be faster than HashSet. Since it use the unique key to get value.
